# 42 BSQ Project

The **BSQ** (Biggest Square) project is an algorithmic challenge focused on finding the largest possible square within a given map. The map consists of a grid filled with obstacles and empty spaces, and the goal is to identify the largest square area that contains only empty spaces.

This project focuses on understanding dynamic programming, matrix manipulation, and efficient problem-solving. You'll implement an algorithm to parse the map, analyze the grid, and determine the coordinates and size of the largest square.

By completing this project, you'll gain a deeper understanding of algorithmic optimization, data structures, and how to approach geometric problems programmatically.
